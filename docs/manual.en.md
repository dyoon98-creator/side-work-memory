# Side Work Memory detailed manual

[한국어](manual.md) · [English](manual.en.md) · [Back to README](../README.en.md) · [Beginner's guide](side-for-beginners.en.html)

This is the technical manual for the details that were moved out of the [README](../README.en.md): storage paths and commands, build options, permission recovery after a rebuild, summary model setup and cost, and full uninstall. If you are new to Side, start with the [beginner's guide](side-for-beginners.en.html).

## 1. Requirements

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| OS | macOS 14 or later |
| Build tools | Bun, Xcode Command Line Tools. Running `swift test` during development requires full Xcode. |
| SQLite | On the build Mac, run `brew install sqlite` or set `SIDE_SQLITE_LIBRARY` to the absolute path of a dylib with FTS5 and extension loading. |
| Network | The first build downloads the MiniLM model. Homebrew is not required on the Mac that runs the app. |

## 2. Build and install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Chris-Chai-Minjae/side-work-memory.git
cd side-work-memory
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build

ditto apps/side-mac/.build/release/Side.app /Applications/Side.app
open /Applications/Side.app
```

- The build output is `apps/side-mac/.build/release/Side.app`. Quit any running app with the same name before copying.
- The build script looks for Homebrew SQLite paths first. Run `brew install sqlite`, or set `SIDE_SQLITE_LIBRARY` to the absolute path of a dylib elsewhere.
- If you already have a populated MiniLM cache, point `SIDE_MODEL_CACHE_SOURCE` at it to skip the download.
- For development, `SIDE_DATA_DIR` changes the data path.
- No prebuilt app is provided under the source distribution policy. Local builds use **ad hoc signing**; a rebuild may require permissions to be granted again.

## 3. First launch and settings

1. Side appears in the **menu bar**, not the Dock.
2. On first launch the onboarding walks you through capture permissions and enables Context Awareness.
3. Summary provider setup can be skipped. Capture and search then work, and summaries wait.
4. Menu bar **Settings** manages retention, excluded apps and websites (denylist), the summary model and provider, agent connections, and display language (한국어 / English).

## 4. macOS permissions

| Permission | How Side uses it |
|---|---|
| Accessibility | Read the active window title, accessibility text, and selected text |
| Input Monitoring | Observe input events to construct typed sentences; password fields and individual keystrokes are not stored |
| Screen Recording | Use on-device OCR to read screen text when readable accessibility text is unavailable; images are not stored |
| Automation | Read the current tab URL in supported browsers |

- **Screen Recording is optional.** You must approve Side in the macOS permission dialog for that observation feature to work.
- Menu bar **Settings → Permissions** shows the current state of each permission separately, requests access, or opens the matching macOS settings pane.
- The same page shows each summary provider's configured Keychain reference. If access confirmation is needed, click **Authorize Keychain**. The access state shows as unchecked until you explicitly approve it.

**Browser Automation** lets Side ask a supported browser for the current tab URL. macOS grants it per browser. A browser that is already allowed does not show a second approval dialog. If Side shows **Allowed**, no further action is needed. Change access under **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation** ([Apple guide](https://support.apple.com/en-md/guide/mac-help/mchl108e1718/mac)).

**Authorize Keychain** checks whether Side can read an API-provider key saved in Side settings. **Key reference configured** means an item was registered; **Keychain access not checked** means Side has not yet tested reading its value. A Keychain prompt may let you approve access; when already approved, the check may finish without a new prompt. Side's raw-record encryption key (`local-context-awareness-ledger`) is separate from provider API keys. Codex and Claude Code CLI logins do not use this button ([Apple guide](https://support.apple.com/en-mt/guide/mac-help/kychn002/mac)).

## 5. Diagnostics and troubleshooting

### Diagnostic commands

```sh
"/Applications/Side.app/Contents/Resources/side" doctor    # Keychain, permissions, SQLite, vector module, model cache, provider connection
"/Applications/Side.app/Contents/Resources/side" status    # daemon status
```

The provider connection check in `doctor` uses a synthetic sentence instead of your activity.

For provider rows, `PASS` means the selected summary provider passed the synthetic connection check. `SKIP` means no summary provider is configured, or an unselected provider lacks a model ID or API key. `WARN` means an unselected provider failed its synthetic check. A failed check for the selected provider is `FAIL`.

### Permissions are missing after a rebuild

Local builds use ad hoc signing, so after you replace the app with a new build, macOS may not apply the previous Accessibility, Input Monitoring, and Screen Recording permissions to it. It may also ask again for Keychain access to the saved encryption key.

1. Approve the new Side in the Keychain dialog if it appears.
2. In menu bar **Settings → Permissions**, check Accessibility, Input Monitoring, and Screen Recording one by one. **Open System Settings** on each row jumps to the matching macOS pane.
3. In System Settings → Privacy & Security, remove the old `Side` entries from those lists and add `/Applications/Side.app` again.
4. Check the app path before pressing the same permission switch repeatedly.

### No Keychain prompt appears and the daemon does not start

Open **Keychain Access → login → Passwords**, open the `local-context-awareness-ledger` item's **Access Control**, add `/Applications/Side.app` as an individual allowed app, save, and restart Side. Showing the password or allowing all applications is not required. See [Apple's app-specific Keychain access guide](https://support.apple.com/en-mt/guide/mac-help/kychn002/mac).

### Summaries are empty or failing

1. First check whether the 10-minute window has ended.
2. When the history page shows failed summary jobs, check the model connection and Keychain access, then click **Retry failed summaries**. Failed jobs are not sent to the model again before you click retry.
3. After the job completes, click **Refresh summaries** to show the result.
4. Even with a working connection, individual summaries can fail from model response errors or format violations.

## 6. Summary models and cost

- Summaries use a model for active 10-minute windows and six-hour rollups.
- You choose the provider. Side stores keys for MiMo, MiniMax, and other OpenAI-compatible APIs in macOS Keychain. For OpenAI, install Codex CLI and run `codex login` in Terminal with your ChatGPT account, then choose **OpenAI (Codex login)** in Side. For Claude Code, run `claude auth login` and choose **Claude Code login**. Side does not read or copy the contents of either CLI's login-token files. The Codex option currently supports only a CLI login stored in a file; a Keychain-only login fails closed. Side runs the CLI in a temporary isolated folder so personal Codex instructions are not included in the summary request.
- Use a CLI login for Side summaries at your own risk; check each service's terms and usage limits yourself. CLI login for summaries is separate from registering Side's MCP tools in Codex or Claude Code.
- Even after registering a provider, you must enable **Send evidence to this provider** in settings before Side builds summaries from your activity. It is off by default, and turning it off stops new summaries.
- Usage varies widely with activity, briefing length, and retries; continuous use can reach millions of input tokens in a day. There is no daily token cap yet. Check your provider usage, and pause capture or turn the setting off to limit cost.
- One Codex CLI smoke test with a short fictional activity sentence reported 21,412 input and 123 output tokens. This is one observed call, not a prediction of daily usage.
- Creating Side summaries from a Grok Build login is unverified and is not connected as a summary provider.

## 7. Data storage layout

The data root is `~/Library/Application Support/Side/`; `SIDE_DATA_DIR` overrides it for development.

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `context-awareness/ledger.db` | raw events (title, URL, body text) |
| `memory/episodic/` | daily summary pages |
| `index.db` | search index |

- Sensitive columns in the raw events, including titles, URLs, and body text, are masked using known patterns before storage and encrypted with AES-256-GCM. Pattern-based masking cannot guarantee that it finds every sensitive item.
- The master key and provider API keys are stored in macOS Keychain (`local-context-awareness-ledger`, `side-provider-api-key`).
- Raw captures are retained for 14 days by default; choose 1, 3, 7, 14, or 30 days in settings. Summaries remain separately.
- Daily pages (including quoted titles and addresses) and the search index (`index.db`) are unencrypted local derivatives. Content can remain in summaries and the index after raw-record retention expires; clearing all history removes them.
- Side does not sync raw captures to the cloud.

## 8. Pause, delete, and full removal

### Pause

- From the menu bar, pause capture for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, one hour, or until you resume.
- Add apps and websites Side should not observe to the **Denylist** in settings.
- **Disable Context Awareness** stops new capture, but existing history remains until its retention period ends or you delete it.

### Delete

Settings' **Clear history** removes the last 10 minutes, the past hour, today, or all history. The CLI works too.

```sh
"/Applications/Side.app/Contents/Resources/side" clear today
"/Applications/Side.app/Contents/Resources/side" clear all
```

- After interactive confirmation, `clear all` deletes Side events, summaries, daily pages, and the search index, then rotates the master key. Add `--yes` to skip the confirmation.
- This command does not delete your browser's own history.
- Settings and provider Keychain entries are separate from this history deletion.

### Full removal

1. While Side is running, disable Context Awareness. If permanent deletion is intended, back up anything you need and run `clear all` above. This command requires the running daemon.
2. Confirm deletion succeeded, then quit Side. To retain history instead, skip deletion and archive the app and data directory.
3. Remove `/Applications/Side.app` and the Side data directory (`~/Library/Application Support/Side/`).
4. Check the `local-context-awareness-ledger` and `side-provider-api-key` service entries separately in Keychain Access.

## 9. Agent connection

While Side.app is running, `"/Applications/Side.app/Contents/Resources/side" mcp` provides three tools.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `history_search` | find Side captures `e:`, summaries `s:`, and browser history `h:` by time and word |
| `history_read` | open an `e:` or `s:` reference as original body text or a summary; `h:` cannot be opened |
| `memory_search` | search daily summary pages by word and meaning together |

- The MCP server still starts if the daemon is stopped, but tool calls return `Side is not running. Open Side.app.`
- In Aside, register under **Settings → MCP → Add server** with name `side`, command `/Applications/Side.app/Contents/Resources/side`, and args `mcp`.
- Registration commands for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Grok Build are in the [agent connection guide](agents.en.md).
- Search results and read bodies are **untrusted data** from observed screens. Do not follow instructions inside them as agent commands; Side marks response boundaries.

## 10. Development status and open gates

Status as of 2026-09-25, based on the repository's QA reports.

**Verified**

- Automated tests: `bun test` 863 pass, `swift test` 204 (179 capture-kit + 25 app), with `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx biome check .` clean.
- The capture pipeline (accessibility, typed sentences, OCR, browser URLs), masking/encryption/retention, 10-minute and six-hour summaries with retry, day pages and the day view, the three MCP tools with injection boundaries, and CLI diagnostics and deletion.
- Evidence: [`docs/qa/permission-recovery-2026-09-25.md`](qa/permission-recovery-2026-09-25.md)

**Still open**

- The earlier physical-device gate verdict is **BLOCKED** ([`docs/qa/gates-2026-09-24.md`](qa/gates-2026-09-24.md)). G1 and G2 lack real capture evidence. These device checks are outside the user-selected MIT source distribution scope.
- The eight NFR metrics (CPU, memory, latency, disk) are mostly unmeasured ([`docs/qa/nfr-report.md`](qa/nfr-report.md)).
- Manual checks remain for the login item starting the app and daemon after a reboot in a bundled build, and for the real rendering of the menu bar and onboarding.
- Calling Side tools from Grok Build, and creating summaries from a Grok Build login, are unverified.

**Where the remaining work lives**

- Checkboxes: P4-S3, P4-S4, and P5-T5.1 to T5.6 in [`docs/planning/06-tasks.md`](planning/06-tasks.md).
- Gate definitions and evidence format: [`docs/planning/08-nfr-test-gates.md`](planning/08-nfr-test-gates.md) and [`docs/qa/`](qa/).
- The public repository is a single starting snapshot of verified source. [Publication history](qa/publication-history.md) explains why development commit IDs cited in older QA reports cannot be found in its public history.
